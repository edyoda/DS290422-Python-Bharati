# syntax
# class <class_name> 

# Method - function created inside a class is known as method.

# self keyword - represent 'this' meaning object of current class.

# static / class variable 
# - variable which is define inside the class but outside the method/constructor are known as static/class variable.
# - the scope is within the class.
# - the class/static variables can be called using class name. 
# - for eg. <class_name>.<static/class_variable_name> 
# - all the static variables shares the same memory
# - hence it is used for memory management
