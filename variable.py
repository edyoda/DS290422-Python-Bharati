"""
Variable
1. Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. 
2. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. 
3. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. 
4. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.
5. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
6. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
"""


num_1 = 2 
print("Number is ",num_1)

# here num_1 is variable
# and 2 is value
# so here we are assigning value(2) to the variable(num_1)
